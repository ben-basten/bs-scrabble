# BS Scrabble

This is a 2 player multiplayer Scrabble knockoff game using Socket.io to support multiple clients and Vue for a responsive drag-and-drop interface.

This was a partner final project for my "Client-Side Programming" class. I designed the UI of the game using Vue and set up the GameBoard class structure while my partner primarily worked on the server-side validation and scoring.

*Note: only 2 clients can be connected at a time! Any additional clients will see an alert that there are too many people connected.*

First, make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

*In the local directory of each project:*

* To install Node dependencies, use the `npm install` command in the Node command prompt
* One dependencies are installed, use the `npm start` command to start the server
* Go to `localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to play!
* Once 2 clients have connected there can be back-and-forth gameplay!
